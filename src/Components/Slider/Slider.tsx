        "It is December, but winter's bite is not yet sharp. Daytime sun still has warmth. The warmth of the service at the resort is just as pleasant. Staying at Makayiram Retreat, it was as though one's home had been transported to a magical place. There was the comfort of being with people who cared, who pampered one with superb food. And the setting was wonderful. Different greens all around, the lush cardamom plants, the very tall and massive trees, the grass. The sky is a beautiful blue which stuns the city dwellers. The background music of the stream running through the property was soothing. Birds called, questioned, chatted and sang. They permitted infrequent glimpses, but were mostly content to play hide and seek among the leafy heights. Butterflies were less shy. The forest enters into one's being one felt part of it. One leaves the place with mind and body rested.",
